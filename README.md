# FaceDetection
 *Work in progress, testing face/eye detection*
* Utilised OpenCV library to create an image/live feed facial detection. Used trained Haar cascades xml files for face and eye classification. Convert said image/live feed into grayscale images for face detection using OpenCVâ€™s in-built functions.
